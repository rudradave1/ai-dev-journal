## `rudradave1/kmp-fintech-starter` — Engineering Update

---

### Cross-Platform Architecture & Project Structure
- **Slimmed the Android entry point** to a minimal bootstrap — all screens and business logic now reside in `commonMain`, establishing this as a true cross-platform KMP template. Android-specific code is reduced to just a few lines of composition.
- **Consolidated `TransactionItem`** into the shared components package and resolved all typos in resource package names, fixing broken navigation and import paths across the codebase.
- **Merged upstream `origin/main`** to align with the latest baseline.

---

### UI/UX Refinements
- **Category chips** redesigned with refined spacing (20.dp horizontal, 12.dp vertical) and corrected layout constraints — eliminating text truncation and achieving a polished, production-grade appearance.
- **Interactive profile screen** now provides user feedback via Snackbars on all button actions. The Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle is fully persisted across sessions and reacts immediately to state changes.
- **Date dimension and date picker UI** updated in the shared module for consistent rendering across platforms.

---

### Localization
- **All transaction categories and statuses** now render using localized string resources from `composeResources` instead of raw enum names — eliminating hardcoded English strings and enabling full internationalization out of the box.

---

### Platform Targets
- **iOS target added** with Swift integration, extending the KMP module's reach to Apple platforms.

---

### Infrastructure & Stability
- **Reverted to the standard SQLite driver** to resolve an unresolved `sqlcipher` build failure. The project now builds and runs reliably without external encryption dependencies, ensuring a working product from first checkout.
